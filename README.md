# My Dotfiles

My dotfiles is a repeatable installation file. It will install the suckless utils and all the software I need, copy configurations to the right locations, install fonts and wallpapers and install black arch utils.

To run this all you need is a clean installation of arch linux with the xorg profile and your drivers of choice.

# Install

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbentes/dotfiles/main/install.sh | sh
```
